* Improved source / spec switching
    - it is now faster and more precise in rails and gem projects
    - handles namespace correctly

    e.g. when trying to switch to the spec for "project/app/controllers/admin/user_controller.rb"
    RSpec will correctly switch to "project/spec/controllers/admin/user_controller_spec.rb"
    instead of the one without "/admin", like it previously did
